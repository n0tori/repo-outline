# repo-outline
A Python script that writes the file structure and code of a directory in a good old fashioned .txt

# Use
- Full codebase:
```python repoOutline.py /path/to/directory/ /path/to/output.txt```
- Partial codebase:
```python repoOutline.py /path/to/directory/ /path/to/output.txt --ignore folder folder/subfolder file.txt anotherfile.md```

# Why
1. Upload file or paste context into LLMs.
2. See how your project looks on paper.
3. Stare at your very organised codebase.
4. Stare at your very disorganised codebase.
5. Have Windows Narrator read it for you like an audiobook.
6. A very <s>in</s>effective version control system for your projects.
7. [Pastebin]([url](https://pastebin.com/)) your codebase?
8. Mainly the first reason though.
